# URL Shortener Service

Goal: Create a URL Shortener Service that takes a url and shortens it with random choice of integers. Using the shortened url will redirect to the original url.
Used HTML and Javascript for the interface and Flask for the backend API endpoints.

To setup:
- run python app.py and use the local host https given to get the start page.
- to get the routes, add onto the end of '/' what route like /list or /shorten or /<short_code>
